    <h3 class="orangeTxt">What am I looking at?</h3>
    <p>In order to showcase my technical knowledge of both form and function I've created a basic web page using only HTML, CSS, bootstrap 3, and angularJS. I normally include a javascript/jquery file, but decided to challenge myself and accomplish those tasks with angularjs. The index.html file contains a head filled with various CDN's for my scripts, a simple logo, a top bar with a bootstrap glyphicon hamburger menu button, the menu itself, the pages header (which gets updated via the angular), bootstrap identifiers for the page scaling, and the content section (also updates via angular).</p>
    <p>The shopping.html file contains only information necessary to display the categories for the shop. It pulls the name of each catagory, the image associated with it, and the url of the categories from the angular javascript file. The shopitem.html page is similar but it has different sclaing properties, and it pulls the variable for the repeat function from a custom eval script. It also contains angular placeholders for names, brands, prices (converted to currency using angular filters), images, and more info/add to car buttons. Currently the buttons are non-functional because this is simlpy a demo, but I intend to include a modal window for the "more info" button.</p>
